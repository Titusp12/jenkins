java -version : to see if you have java installed, or else go to oracle.com
vi .bashrc can be created in github and you can set alias by alias l="ls -lrt" and logout and login

ls -lrt > output.txt (REDIRECT) this will create a command into the file
> for new file

ln -- is creating shortcut
insted of cat /tmp/abc.txt in case you are in home directory,
do ln -s /tmp/abc.txt shortcut.txt

if you are editing you are directly editing abc.txt
cd -- go to home directory


more filename -- goes page wise space is forward b is backward
go to root sudo su - and confirm using whoami
cd /var/log and list files and perform more
cat message and do more message
head message --first 10
tail message --last 10
chmod u+x lmn.sh  and you can also do chmod o-x lmn.sh
chmod a+x lmn.sh , a= all user, group and others

be in root
chown change ownership of the file
create user-- useradd loki
create passwd -- passwd loki

chown robin:robin shortcut.txt instead of ec2-user ec2-user
now you cannot view the shortcut.txt as ec2-user


you can connect public key using
/home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized-keys

idrsa - private (you must not share it)
idrsa.pub -- public (you can share it)

....
in 1st machine:  ssh-keygen -t rsa  --- you will get public rsa file with .pub and copy it
in 2nd machine : authorized_keys paste the public rsa of first machine
in 1st machine:  ssh -i /home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa ec2-user@ipof2ndmachine

from 1st machine: ssh ec2user@ip --- will go into another machine
scp 
scp git.tar.gz ec2-user@18.216.186.20:/home/ec2-user/











to share files, if a gives public key to b, a can see contents of b


for ex: 1st machine: cat id_rsa.pub as ec2-user and copy
2nd machine: sudo su newuser
do whoami 
newuser
create new .ssh directory 
chmod 700 .ssh
cd .ssh
vi authorized_keys and paste there
chmod 600 authorized_keys
in 1st machine : ssh -i /home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa newuser@2ndmachine_ip


su new_user_name --switched-user-name
if you want to do it with new user
.ssh 700
authorized user 600

try hostname
history

shift plus dollar -- last line in vi
clrt + c = clrt+ insert
paste = shift +insert
